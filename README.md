Git is relevant to me because it allows me to be more adventurous with the concepts I want to try out with code, while also allowing me to fall back onto previous versions if my endeavours don't pan out so well. GitHub is relevant to me because without it, I wouldn't have the ability to access my code and share it with my friends and with the world as easily as it makes it to be.
